# The Matrix CSS Project

## Description
This project, created for a CSS course assignment, is a mini creative project consisting of two webpages providing a cohesive and interactive experience centered around the theme of The Matrix movie. Developed using pure HTML and CSS, the webpages feature hover effects, animations, and navigation buttons, offering users a visually engaging exploration journey through various elements inspired by The Matrix.

## Getting Started
1. Download the project by clicking "Download as ZIP" under the code menu.
2. Extract the zip file and open the `2021.10.07-school-css-submission` folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Run `introside.html` with the Live Server extension to start exploring the project.

## Usage
Upon launching `introside.html`, users are presented with a choice between a red or blue pill, reminiscent of the iconic scene from The Matrix. Choosing the blue pill redirects users to vg.no, while the red pill leads to the next page. 

On the subsequent page, users can interact with an animated Neo who dodges the cursor when it approaches him, returning to the original position upon cursor withdrawal. The page also features a navigation bar detailing The Matrix films. Hovering over each navbar tab reveals a dropdown containing information about the corresponding movie, including a description, actor details, and the movie poster. 

Explore various hover animations by placing the cursor over different elements:
- Hover over actor names to view animations of the characters they portray.
- Movie posters have a unique glitching hover effect.
